# What is it?
A Windows desktop app that should calculate the volume of Oil & Gas between the 2 horizons and above the fluid contact.
The user should be able to get the results in of the following 3 units: cubic meter, cubic feet and barrels.

## Dataset
The following data is available:

1. Base Horizon = Top Horizon + 100 meter
2. Fluid contact = 3000 meter

3. Top Horizon: = 2D regular grid format + depth value at every node.
- Lateral dimension: 16 x 26
- Lateral grid cell sizes: 200 x 200 feet!

The file below lists the 16x26 depth values of the top horizon(specified in feet)
